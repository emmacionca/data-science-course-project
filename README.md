# Data Science Course Project

## How To Use the Notebook:
* From this repository, download the files data_science_course_project.ipynb.
* Then, visit https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-usa?select=us_counties_covid19_daily.csv and download the file titled "us_counties_covid19_daily.csv" (the file was too large to be included in this repository).
* Next, it is important to make sure that the device you're running the code from has several libraries installed. These libraries are sometimes not installed on Google Colab by default. The notebook provides pip install commands that should work on any device.
* Next, you can run the cells up until you get to the read_csv cell. To run this cell, you need to install the file us_counties_covid19_daily.csv from the Kaggle link provided above and have it in the same directory you're running the code from so that it can read the CSV file.
* Once you've done this, you can run the rest of the code contained in the notebook, and you should achieve the same results listed in the notebook in this repository.
* If you would like to save any of the figures presented in the notebook, feel free to uncomment any of the .savefig() commands in the notebook for the cell that contains the figure you want to save.
